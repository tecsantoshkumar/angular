                                        <p> The ETABS is known as Extended Three-Dimensional Analysis of Building System. It is a highly sophisticated and useful special-purpose analysis and design program specifically designed to work with construction systems. Massive and complex models of buildings are easily adapted by integrating systems. The ETABS modeling is the notion that multi-story structures typically contain similar or identical floor plans that are repeated on a vertical basis.</p>
