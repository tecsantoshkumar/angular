                                            teaching informative content and practical classes to benefit students. I've
                                            completed the CAM, CAD, and practical CNC lathe classes, and hands-on work

                                            concepts at Nipuna Technologies. The course is well-organized and the
                                            trainer has an extensive understanding of the concepts. The course begins
                                            with the basics before it goes into aspects of CAM as well as CNC aspects of
                                            designing manufacturing. I recommend this course in case you already have
                                            experience with CAD modeling as well as drawings. </p>
