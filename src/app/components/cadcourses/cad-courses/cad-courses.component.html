                                        <p> The vast majority of CAD applications are used for the design of machinery and tools used in the manufacturing of components. They also play an important role in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, including small residential structures (houses) and large commercial and industrial structures (hospitals, factories), and many more </p>
                                        <p> The majority of AutoCAD is used to detail engineer 3D models and/or 2D drawings of physical components. However, it can also be used throughout the engineering process, from conceptual design and product layout, strength and dynamic analysis of assembly, to the definition of manufacturing methods for components. </p>
                                        <p> For Computer-Aided Technologies, AutoCAD has made a very important technology. It offers many benefits, including lower product development costs and a shorter design cycle. </p>
                                        <p> Designers can use CAD to design and create work on the screen, save it for future editing with this saving time on the product drawings and print it out. </p>

                                        <p> I decided to take CATIA training, and it was a great experience learning
                                            about Nipuna Technologies. The overall experience that I had with the
                                            institute was excellent both in terms of the training, and the management
                                            staff, as well. The training we received from the trainer has allowed me to
                                            enhance my skills in real-time. </p>

                                        <p> I joined the AutoCAD course at Nipuna Technologies and it is a great and most excellent training institute in Guntur for AutoCAD training. After my graduation, I am from a Civil background. I was very confused about my carrier one of my brothers told me to learn AutoCAD and Civil 3D courses and he suggested that Nipuna technologies are the best to join. I attended the demo classes and I decided and want to learn self-paced with the most experienced, excellent, and real-time trainers. My humble thanks to the trainer, he is an excellent trainer in teaching CAD classes. I recommend everyone to join Nipuna Technologies for CAD training. Now I am no more confused about my career, thanks to the Management team of Nipuna technologies and once again thanks to the trainer. </p>

I came from Vinukonda just to learn the Catia Course. I would like to mention my trainer, who taught each and every concept of the course very easily so that I never felt that the course was difficult during the training. Without any doubt, I would like to refer to Nipuna Technologies in my network. </p>
