                                        <p> AutoCAD is a part of CAD software that was developed by Autodesk and is
                                            geared toward professional use for creating manufacturing plans for various
                                            projects. AutoCAD is a versatile tool that is used in a variety of
                                            industries, so taking the time to learn AutoCAD designing is a necessary
                                            skill for Mechanical Engineers. The initial version of the software had only
                                            primitive objects, such as circles, polygons, or arcs, as well as text to
                                            create complex objects. The software later came to allow custom objects via
                                            an interface for application programming. </p>
                                        <p> The most recent version of AutoCAD comes with the full set of commands that
                                            support solid modeling as well as 3D. AutoCAD also supports various
                                            interfaces to application programs that allow for customized and automated
                                            work. DWG (drawing) is the primary file format used by AutoCAD and the most
                                            widely used format for the interoperability of CAD data. AutoCAD also
                                            supports DWG (drawing) which is the Design Web Format (DWF) format, which
                                            was created by Autodesk to publish CAD data.</p>

                                        <p> You will track the design process of engineering using drawings in 2D for
                                            better design communication and coordination between different project
                                            teams. </p>
                                        <p> You will understand the needs of the Drafting process and reduce risk, and
                                            develop more efficient designs.</p>
                                        <p> By using CAD Software you will be speeding up drawing and the detailed
                                            process through enhanced visualization with the help of 2D drawings. </p>
                                        <p> You will build a model using to create a detailed model in a 2D drawing
                                            layout, sketch the views and details using its tolerances, and then access
                                            details about the model's database. </p>
                                        <p> You will design and document by drafting and detailing the project with a 2D
                                            model, which included the non-geometric and geometric design, as well as
                                            component information.</p>
                                        <p> Learn about tools that can help you organize and track different stages
                                            throughout the life cycle of a product. </p>
                                        <p> You will create manufacturing design concepts using the modeling and then
                                            develop documents and reports. </p>

                                        <p> I have completed AutoCAD Mechanical Course from Nipuna Technologies. It
                                            provides the training was informative and instructive. The course was very
                                            good, and the instructor had a good understanding the concepts of CAD
                                            Courses. The institute is equipped with good infrastructure for classrooms
                                            and the material is great and efficient. This training has enabled me to
                                            gain a thorough understanding of AutoCAD. I personally suggest that people
                                            sign up with Nipuna Technologies for all CADD courses. </p>

                                                    for various projects. AutoCAD is a versatile tool that is used in a
                                                    variety of industries, the initial version of the software had only
                                                    primitive objects, such as circles, polygons, or arcs, as well as
