                                        <p> I have completed SolidWorks Course from Nipuna Technologies. It provides the
                                            training was informative and instructive. The course was very good and the
                                            instructor had a good understanding of SolidWorks. The institute is equipped
                                            with good infrastructure for classrooms and the material is great and
                                            efficient. This training has enabled me to gain a thorough understanding of
                                            SolidWorks. I personally suggest that people sign up with Nipuna
                                            Technologies for all CADD courses. </p>

                                        <p> Hello, my name is Rajesh of mechanical engineering. I have joined SolidWorks
                                            in the year 2021at Nipuna technologies. First of all, I want to express my
                                            gratitude to my trainer for his teaching style is exceptional and I learned
                                            from the fundamentals to advanced concepts of SolidWorks. I was able to
                                            complete the course with three mini-projects as well as one main project. It
                                            is highly recommended as the Best SolidWorks Training Institute in Guntur

                                                <p> SolidWorks helps in translating new ideas into designs quickly and
                                                    effectively. SolidWorks can help the designer or engineer
                                                    efficiently communicate their design ideas to someone or users who
