                                    <div class="mb-0 description">
                                        <p> CREO is a Software suite of programs that were developed by Parametric
                                            Technology Corporation (PTC) to assist in the design of products. In the
                                            past, Creo was called Pro/Engineer (Pro E). It is a CAD/CAM/CAE-based 3D
                                            solid modeling software. Creo Parametric is utilized by mechanical
                                            engineers/designers to perform Solid modeling and assembly modeling Finite
                                            element analysis two-dimensional orthographic viewing sub-divisional and
                                            NURBS surfacing as well as parametric and direct modeling, as well as NC and
                                            tooling functions. </p>
                                        <p> Creo Elements/Parametric competes with other programs like SolidWorks,
                                            CATIA, and NX/Solid Edge. Creo parametric can be described as an updated
                                            version of Pro-E that is ideal for analysis, modeling, and simulation. It is
                                            widely employed for design and development at various automobile companies
                                            and manufacturing industries. </p>

                                        <p> Creo Training at Nipuna Technologies was overall excellent. The entire
                                            syllabus for this Creo Courses with assignments was made me gain so much
                                            knowledge in product design development.  I got a job with package 3 lacs,
                                            all credit goes directly to Nipuna Technologies! Great Job.</p>

                                            a mechanical engineer and recently, I have been keen on learning product
                                            design applications. This is why I decided to join Nipuna Technologies. The
                                            overall experience at Creo Training was great. The most enjoyable part was
                                            the practical sessions. The institute has the most practical training.
                                            Thanks a lot, Nipuna Technologies.</p>

                                                <p> CREO is a Software suite of programs that was developed by
                                                    Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) to assist in the design of
                                                    products. In the past, Creo was called Pro/Engineer (Pro E). It is a
                                                    CAD/CAM/CAE-based 3D solid modeling software. Creo Parametric is
                                                    utilized by mechanical engineers/designers to perform Solid modeling

                                                    computers. If you put in the effort, then a maximum of three months
