Currently, machine learning is being used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, recommender system, and many more. The delicacy of predicted output depends upon the volume of data, as the huge quantity of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately. </p>
