                                        <p> I enrolled in the Python (full stack) course in Guntur at Nipuna technologies. The instructors have hands-on experience with Python projects and a lot of patience when clearing doubts. The trainers have structured the course with great logic and I'm not seeing any gaps or jumps in the concepts. Every module has practice questions that are on the right level. The Placement team conducts rapid mock tests to check the level of understanding of the concepts and helps you identify areas to improve. Thanks to Nipuna technologies </p>

                                        <p> I've successfully completed Python in Nipuna Technologies, Guntur. It was extremely useful and the syllabus of the course was very informative. The notes as well as the recorded sessions in Python were extremely useful. Friendly trainers every topic was explained through practical exercises and the methods used to teach are excellent. The modules they teach are simple to grasp. Although it seems easy during the lectures more complex challenges are presented during the practice sessions, that require additional individual study. It is possible to get in touch with the instructors for more advice. It's a good option for placements, I was offered a position at HCL after I completed my Python course. Thanks to my trainer as well as the Nipuna Technologies </p>
