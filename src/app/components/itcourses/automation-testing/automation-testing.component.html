                                    <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> What is Automation Testing? </h3>
                                    <div class="mb-0 description">
                                        <p> Automation Testing is software testing that uses special automated software tools to run a test suite. Manual Testing, on the other hand, is done by a human who sits in front of a computer and carefully executes the test steps.</p>
                                        <p> Automation testing software also allows you to enter test data into the System Under Test. This will allow you to compare actual and expected results, and generate detailed reports. Software Test Automation requires significant investments in money and resources.</p>

                                        <p> When a company develops a software or product, to ensure seamless user experiences, companies must identify and fix any flaws before releasing the product. The testing team is responsible for performing various types of testing from functional to nonfunctional to ensure that the product works efficiently and provides a better user experience.</p>
                                        <p> Although testers can do both manual and automation testing, Automation Testing is much more efficient and provides precise results. This results in faster delivery. </p>

                                        <p> The Nipuna Technologies Automation Testing Training Course was incredible. The trainer of this course was an amazing experience. I was able to upgrade my knowledge in the field of testing and become an automation tester. The trainers were very helpful and explained the concepts clearly. We also received a lot of practice assignments so I am confident that we will be able to face interviews. This institute is highly recommended for any software courses. Thank you Nipuna Technologies for supporting me in placements.
