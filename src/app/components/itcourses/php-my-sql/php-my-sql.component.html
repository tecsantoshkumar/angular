                                                    These both are completely different technologies and therefore these
                                                    are used for different purposes. </p>

                                                <p>PHP is a server-side programming language that records all the user's
                                                    data which requires a database on the server. PHP programming
                                                    language requires interaction with the MySQL database. since it is
                                                    advisable to start learning PHP first and then go for MySQL.
