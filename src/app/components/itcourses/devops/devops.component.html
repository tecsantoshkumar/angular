                                    <div class="mb-0 description">

                                        <p>The word DevOps says that it is a combination of two words that is
                                            Development and Operations. It is a software development technique that
                                            provides the collaboration between Software Development and Information
                                            Technology Operations to make the software production and deployment in an
                                            automated & repeatable way. DevOps is preferred as high-quality software in
                                            very short development cycles & helps to increase the organization’s speed
                                            to deliver software applications and services which ends up in greater user
                                            satisfaction.</p>
                                        <p>DevOps, the IT Operations team is completely aware of the project that the
                                            developers are making. These IT Operations teams interact with developers
                                            and jointly develop a monitoring plan that caters to the delivery of the IT
                                            business needs. They also use advanced Application Performance Monitoring
                                            (APM) automated Tools. DevOps merge the development and operation team for
                                            faster, smoother, and timely delivery of product or application. Without
                                            DevOps, developers are spending a large amount of their time in testing,
                                            deploying, and designing for building the project. DevOps has a deep
                                            integration between the process of development and operations. Learning
                                            DevOps is impossible without having in-depth knowledge of DevOps lifecycle.

                                            DevOps Course in Guntur</h2>
                                        <p>DevOps career is one of the developing fields in the IT industry. The
                                            increased deployment of DevOps technology in the IT industry is because of
                                            rising demand for the faster, smoother and timely delivery of the product or
                                            application. Before the DevOps technology, the IT industry followed the
                                            method of software development such as the Waterfall and Agile method which
                                            occupied the maximum time & also caused numerous product failures. These
                                            were some of main reasons why IT & Business began to adopt DevOps
                                            technology. Based on the reports it is predicted that the overall market
                                            size of the DevOps is expected to rise to $10 billion by the end of 2023
                                            because of growing demand to produce the software at a faster delivery
                                            that’s way there is a dictated growth of increased DevOps professionals in
                                            the IT Sector.</p>

                                            I completed DevOps coaching in Guntur at Nipuna Technologies. This DevOps
                                            course is very helpful for me to get a job in HCL and to enhance my
                                            knowledge. My trainers motivated me to finish my course and also the
                                            interview point of questions was taught to me. I got good experience in this
                                            training. Thank you so much to the trainer and Nipuna Technologies for your
                                            quality coaching.

                                            I did a DevOps course in Nipuna Technologies and it was really a useful
                                            session for me. Helped me to switch to Devops from being a Java developer.
                                            As promised, Nipuna Technologies trainer's provided me with a lot of
                                            practical sessions and hands-on training with live projects. The front
                                            office staff was so flexible in scheduling the classes according to the
                                            convenience of the students
