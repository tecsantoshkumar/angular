                                        <p> I opted for Dot NET training and it was great learning from Nipuna
                                            Technologies. The overall experience that I had with this institute was
                                            great, both in terms of the training and the Management staff as well. The
                                            practical training by our trainer has enabled me to improve my real-time
                                            performance.</p>

                                        <p>When I joined Nipuna Technologies for Web designing Training, I didn't really
                                            expect a lot from it, to be extremely honest. But as time went by, I
                                            realized I got exactly what I wanted from Nipuna Technologies - a healthy
                                            environment for learning, Expert Trainers, and their valuable lectures make
                                            me understand things so much easy. I thank Nipuna Technologies for having
                                            been so supportive throughout the course and making me get a good job in
                                            MNC.
