                                    <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> What is Hardware and Networking? </h3>
                                    <div class="mb-0 description">
                                        <p>IT hardware and networking are growing rapidly with time. The hardware and
                                            networking have carried ahead from physical server stations to cloud storage
                                            and virtualization. Hardware and networking are interlinks of several
                                            computer parts and networks. This interconnection can be either on a large
                                            scale basis or on a small scale basis. When you connect a very huge set of
                                            systems with each other and with the database and servers then it is
                                            large-scale interconnection. When you connect computers with scanners,
                                            printers, modems, routers, etc., it becomes small-scale interconnection.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Computer Hardware is the combination of tools, machines, and other durable
                                            equipment like physical parts of the computer system. It includes a monitor,
                                            keyboard, mouse, hard disk drive, graphic card, RAM, motherboard, etc.</p>
                                        <p>Networking is the field of computer science that allows systems to exchange
                                            data or information. Information can be interchanged either by connecting
                                            through cables or wireless media.</p>

                                        <p>Hi, this is Ram! I am really delighted about the Hardware and Networking course and I
                                            am surprised to see the depth of my trainer knowledge in all aspects of the course
                                            content. I see that many trainers with over 15+ yrs experience don't have the
                                            knowledge that you have. I really enjoyed your Hardware and Networking Sessions,
                                            definitely look forward to learning more from you in the future. Thanks again.</p>

                                        <p>I started Hardware and Networking course at Nipuna Technologies with no knowledge at
                                            all, and I completed this course with a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge.
                                            This is all because of my trainer, who is very good at explaining subjects very
                                            clearly. I know many people who know the subject and cannot express or explain it to
                                            students in an understandable way, but you rock the subject. One last thing about my
                                            trainer, you are a very good trainer. So far in my experience, you are the best,
                                            thanks for all the support</p>
