                                        <p>I completed an AutoCAD Courses from Nipuna Technologies. It provides
                                            excellent training worth the price! The training is well planned and gives
                                            sufficient time for students to completely understand. The curriculum is
                                            structured in such a way that I gained complete knowledge on AutoCAD nicely.
                                            There were modules tests, assignments, and a final exam to get the training
                                            certificate. The trainer explained the basics of advanced concepts very well
