                                        <p> I enrolled in the SketchUp course in Nipuna Technologies. It is a very
                                            informative course structure and I got a job after the course. The greatest
                                            thing was the trainer's methods of teaching and I have to say that he has
                                            made the concepts of the course easy. Practical learning and industrial
                                            applications, and a full-on practical knowledge. Each time I had a problem,
                                            the trainer was there to assist in clearing my doubts. Institute also gave
                                            me job opportunities frequently and great support for placement. </p>

                                            employed at an engineering company in Guntur and attends the classes on
                                            weekends. According to what I have heard, it's a better institution compared
                                            to other institutions within and close to Guntur as well as Vijayawada.
