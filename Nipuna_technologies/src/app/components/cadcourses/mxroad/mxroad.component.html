                                        <p> At first, I was hesitant to pursue the MX Road training. Even though the
                                            Internet has a wide range of information, there is a gap in learning and
                                            practicing. After joining the training at Nipuna Technologies. I gained
                                            everything I was hoping for. My trainer was able to give me all the help
                                            needed to address my questions. I am confident that such support isn't
                                            available elsewhere in Guntur. I would like to suggest Nipuna Technologies s
                                            to all my friends due to the training program, which is amazing and covers
                                            all the concepts of the training course. The course helped me get to an
                                            extent of knowledge where I could become a confident user of the tools
                                            available in the software. </p>
