                                        <p> Nipuna Technologies offers <b>3D printing Courses in Guntur.</b> This course is
                                            designed to train our students in basic to advanced concepts of 3D printing.
                                            It is known as the manufacturing process that forms or develops a physical
                                            object from a digital design. There are numerous 3D printing technologies
                                            and materials, and all are working on the same principle that, a digital
                                            model is divided into a solid 3D object by adding layer after layer. </p>
                                        <p> This <b>3D printer training in Guntur</b> course will cover the working of 3D
                                            printers technologies, show what people make with them, and examine the 3D
                                            printing ecosystem. The 3D printing course will also explore the future of
                                            it and discuss how it will revolutionize the world. Upon the completion of
                                            this course, students will have an in-depth knowledge of 3D printing, its
                                            potential, and the ability to develop 3D designs</p>

                                        <p> 3D printing is the process of making 3D solid objects using a digital
                                            design. In 3D printing materials such as liquid molecules or powder, grains
                                            are joined/fused/solidified together under computer control to create a 3D
                                            object. It is basically the process of putting the binder material or
                                            binding agent (substance or material that is used to hold or draw other
                                            materials) on a powder bed using an inkjet printer head one layer at a time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> 3D printing is an additive manufacturing method and therefore, it could
                                            replace the subtractive manufacturing method where plastic or metal was cut
                                            or hollowed into pieces, like milling machines.</p>
                                        <p> 3D printing allows the creation of complex designs without using more
                                            materials than traditional manufacturing methods.</p>

                                        <p> I attended 3D printing classes at Nipuna Technologies, and our trainer
                                            offered a brief overview and an understanding of the 3D Printing concept
                                            very thoroughly, allowing me to acquire a thorough understanding of
                                            designing prototypes. An essential course for those who are interested in
                                            engineering and innovation. This course was helpful in gaining more
                                            knowledge of the benefits that 3D printing can provide and the ways it could
                                            help in changing how we live. It also provided me with reasons to consider
                                            the field of 3D printing as a career. </p>

                                        <p> Hello, my name is Swathi and as I am working in a reputed company, I
                                            enrolled in Nipuna technologies for a 3D printing course. The course has
                                            changed my perception of 3D printing from a different angle. I'm looking
                                            forward to making this a part of my future career. This is an excellent
                                            course, even if not heard of 3D printing, or if you've used the 3D printer
                                            for some time I would highly suggest it to anyone who is interested in the
                                            product design field.</p>

                                        <p> I took part in a 3D printing Course with Nipuna Technologies The videos in
                                            this course are very useful to learn the concepts practically. They
                                            conducted numerous mock interviews with students to check their knowledge of
                                            the course. They conduct group discussions on specific issues related to 3D
                                            printing. Each gives their opinions about what the future holds for 3D
                                            printing. Each of the diverse perspectives and views made me realize the
                                            significance of 3D printing both at an industrial and a consumer level. 
                                            Although I didn't have a 3D printer prior to when I completed this course I
                                            was able to learn many things! </p>
