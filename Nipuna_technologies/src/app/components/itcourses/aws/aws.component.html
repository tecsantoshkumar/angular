                                        <p> AWS Certifications stand as the most in-demand expertise in cloud computing. AWS can be categorized into 3 classifications which are: Solutions Architect, Developer, and SysOps. Whilst Solutions Architect is a distinctive career path in Amazon Web Services, a Developer and/or SysOps Associate qualification potentially leads to a DevOps Engineer certification. </p>
                                        <p> You may choose which AWS careers you want to pursue, professional goals, and experience. It is crucial to remember that no prior AWS expertise is required for the Associate-level certifications. However, experts feel that about a year of expertise with any of the AWS products will be extremely beneficial in completing the examinations more quickly.
