                                            extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is machine-independent

                                    <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold">What is C Programming Language?</h3>
                                    <p>C-language is a powerful structured programming language that is extremely
                                        popular,
                                        simple, and flexible to use &amp; it is strongly associated with the UNIX
                                        operating
                                        system. Initially, the C programming was limited only to the UNIX operating
                                        system,
                                        but as it started spreading around the globe, it became commercial, and many
                                        compilers were released for cross-platform systems. Today the language C is
                                        rushed
                                        under a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms.</p>
                                    <p>Programming languages like C++/Java are developed from C &amp; they are widely
                                        used
                                        in various technologies. Thus, the language C forms a base for many other
                                        languages
                                        that are currently in use. If anyone knows C you can easily grasp the knowledge
                                        of
                                        the other programming languages that use the concept of ‘C’. such as the syntax
                                        of
                                        Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other programming languages. C++ programming
                                        language is nearly a superset of language C (Few programs may compile in C, but
                                        not
                                        in C++). </p>

                                        leading C language Course in Guntur? </h3>


                                    <p>Nipuna Technologies is particularly focused on trending C Programming Language
                                        technical skills as well as to get real-time exposure in IT programming field.
                                        The
                                        main focused features of C program include low-level memory access, a simple set
                                        of
                                        keywords, and a clean style. With these features the language C is suitable for
                                        system programming like an operating system or compiler development. Later many
                                        languages have taken the syntax/features directly or indirectly from the
                                        language of
                                        C . Like the features of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are
                                        based
                                        on the C program</p>
