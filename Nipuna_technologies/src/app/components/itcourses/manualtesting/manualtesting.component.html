                                            professionals’ requirements. It is the fundamental testing process and it is
                                            mandatory for every newly developed software before automated testing as it
                                            can find both visible and hidden defects of the application. Manual Testing
                                            provides bug-free software but requires great effort and time. Manual
                                            testing is a fundamental process because complete testing of any software or
                                            application is not possible with automation tools.</p>

                                    <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> What is Manual Testing? </h3>
                                    <div class="mb-0 description">
                                        <p>Manual testing is a software or application testing process in which
                                            high-level test cases are executed manually without using any automated
                                            tool. All test cases are executed by the tester manually to explore
                                            application issues and enhance the end user's perspective. This testing
                                            technique ensures whether the application or software is working, as
                                            mentioned in the requirement document or not. The reports of test cases are
                                            also generated manually.</p>
                                        <p>Companies are also hiring testers who have knowledge of dynamic test design
                                            techniques to ensure the best end-user perspective on various applications.
                                            This software testing requires a wide knowledge of various tools and
                                            technologies. The difference between the expected output and the present
                                            output is defined as a defect. The developer fixed the defects and handed
                                            them to the tester for retesting.</p>
