            <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> What is Mulesoft Course?</h3>
            <div class="mb-0 description">
            <p> MuleSoft Anypoint is planned for an event-driven design (EDA) as well as Mule Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). MuleSoft integrates this by connecting information, applications, and devices using APIs that allow associations to evolve and grow speedier. Accept the request and include the needs of the client in a structured form. Feedback from customers is possible to restore at this point.</p>
            <p> MuleSoft has a wide range of predefined APIs that are compatible with all kinds of systems and applications. By adding the API to your legacy system, you will enjoy a new method to interact with the system, without having to know the way it functions. Every cloud system comes with an intermediate API, known as the system API. This API is able to be understood by modern systems languages and, in turn, exchange information. The majority of MuleSoft APIs are interconnected and serve different purposes. </p>
