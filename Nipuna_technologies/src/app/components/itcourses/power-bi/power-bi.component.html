                                            Microsoft. Power BI Analysts use this tool for data visualisation, to extract
                                            insights from the tool, to share the visual reports and dashboards across the
                                            organization. Moreover, anyone can access these reports from anywhere or sitting at

                                        <p> Power BI is a cluster of data visualisation reports that work together to turn
                                            different sources of data into well-structured, visually immersive, and informative
                                            insights. The data source may be an Excel spreadsheet, cloud-based, and hybrid Data
                                            warehouses. Power BI connects easily to all the data sources, visualizes and

                                        <p> I would like to share about my Power BI training at Nipuna Technologies. The
                                            trainers here are super supportive and they make me understand each and every
                                            concept very clearly. The second upside is definitely the amount of friendliness in
                                            their approach whenever we had doubts. Thirdly, this institute offers extra support
                                            to students who are weaker in understanding the concepts. They gave me the recorded
                                            sessions which helped me really to gain complete knowledge of the course
                                            practically.</p>
