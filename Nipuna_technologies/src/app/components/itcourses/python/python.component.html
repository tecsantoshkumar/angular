                                            to advanced concepts of Python. The Python training curriculum was designed
                                            for beginners and working professionals.Python is currently one of the most
                                            popular, high-level, general-purpose programming languages. It is widely
                                            used in commercial sectors including programming, web development, machine
                                            learning, and data science. Guido van Rossum invented it in 1991, and the
                                            Python Software Foundation expanded on it. It was created with code
                                            readability in consideration, and its syntax lets programmers communicate
                                            their ideas in fewer lines of code. Python has outperformed Java to become
                                            the most popular programming language, which is not surprising considering
                                            its widespread use. Python is a programming language that allows you to work
                                            fast and efficiently integrate systems. </p>
