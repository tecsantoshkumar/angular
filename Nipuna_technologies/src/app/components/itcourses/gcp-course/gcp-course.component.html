The complete training is online and I received recorded sessions if I missed the class, so it made the classes very friendly. Due to the network issues, I used to get stuck and was unable to clear all my doubts. After the training also the trainer supported me and trained me on soft skills like how to crack the interviews. Thank you to my trainer and management staff for being very supportive.</p>
