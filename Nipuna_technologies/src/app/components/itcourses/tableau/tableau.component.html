                                        </h3>
                                        <p> The demand to Tableau developers is increasing and their responsibilities are also
                                            increasing. Here are the duties and responsibilities of Tableau developer. A Tableau
                                            Developer's role is to solve business-related issues and develop technological
                                            solutions. They may use visual analytics tools to create an new solution.
                                            Professionals are expected to be proficient enough to work using storage software.
                                            The online analytical process is the process by which the developer is responsible
                                            for protecting the information of the company within the organization. They also
                                            need to create queries and conduct regular tests to analyze the results and follow
                                            the same procedure throughout the process of development. The developer should
                                            possess a complete life-cycle working experience with the software. The amount of
                                            data will surely increase in line with the development of business and the developer
                                            will be able to enhance the system in line with the changes. </p>
