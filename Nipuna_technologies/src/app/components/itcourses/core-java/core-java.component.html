                                        <p> Nipuna Technologies offers a <b>Core Java Course in Guntur.</b> This course
                                            is designed to train our students in basic to advanced concepts of Core
                                            Java. Core Java is a component in Java which is J2SE which contains all the
                                            essentials of Java comprising some fundamentals and information about
                                            packages. It's an independent Java application that includes all aspects of
                                            OOP principles to specific operators including data types, class wrappers,
                                            and from the linked list to the Array list and queues to handle exceptions.
                                            There are three platforms for computing built around Java, the Java
                                            programming language which includes Java SE. It's still the most used
                                            platform that is based on the idea of OOP and is used primarily to develop
                                            desktop apps. Alongside the APIs for general-purpose use and tools for
                                            development and a virtual machine and other classes libraries. It also
                                            contains an official specification for Java virtual machines. </p>

                                        <p> <b>Core Java </b> is the definition of the fundamental Java that covers the
                                            basic concepts of Java programming languages. We are all aware that Java is
                                            among the most popular and well-known Object-oriented language. In order to
                                            start learning Java, the beginners must begin by learning Core Java and then
                                            towards Advance Java. The core Java is a Java program language and it is a
                                            general-purpose programming languages that is founded based on the OOPs
                                            concept. The depths in Java are too vast to be mastered, i.e., as you get
                                            more familiar with it you will be aware of the depth of it. Java is an open
                                            and stable programming languages. The principle that is followed by Java is
                                            WORA which means Write Once and Run Anywhere. The language of programming is
                                            simple and easy to learn. However, it is important to know the fact that
                                            Core Java is not different from Java. Java is a complete program in and of
                                            itself however, for those who are new to Java it is natural that the
                                            aspirants should begin by understanding the basic concepts of Java. In
                                            reality, Java has different editions and Core Java is one of them. Core Java
                                            is one of the components of a Java Standard edition.</p>

                                        <p> I completed a Java full-stack course through Nipuna technologies. The course
                                            was very good and the trainer had excellent knowledge of the core Java and
                                            the institution offered a well-equipped classroom. This course has enabled
                                            me to gain expert knowledge by working on live projects using Java
                                            frameworks. I would recommend this institute to take any of the courses
