                                        <p>Hello friends, I completed my training in Tally ERP 9 with Nipuna Technologies through an online course. The trainer was excellent and all the concepts were covered in a very simple manner. I also got practical support wherever needed. I am happy about the training. The team of Nipuna technologies is very supportive and dedicated and they also provided me Tally coaching with placement. Thanks, Nipuna technologies.

                                        </p>

                                        <p>I Joined a Tally online course with Nipuna Technologies. The complete training is online and I received recorded sessions if I missed the class, so it made the classes very friendly. Due to the network issues, I used to get stuck and was unable to clear all the doubts. After the training also the trainer supported me and trained me on soft skills like how to crack the interviews. Thank you to my trainer and management staff for being very supportive.
