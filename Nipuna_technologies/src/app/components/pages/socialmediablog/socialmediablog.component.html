                                        <p> Facebook groups have a higher visibility in the newsfeed that Facebook pages. Any member of a group can post to the group and it will be visible in all members' news feeds. </p>
                                        <p> Groups are great for communities and causes that allow everyone to participate in the discussion.

                                        <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> Take Advantage of trending topics. </h3>

                                        <p> For ideas on how you can attract new customers and get the conversation started, it's a smart idea to check out trending topics on Facebook. But you should not jump on the most talked about topics if they don't relate to your business.</p>
                                        <p> The trending topics have changed the way people access content. They are the most talked about topics on any platform. They are a way to see what is hot and they can be adjusted to suit your location. You should start looking at trending topics to find inspiration for your next social-media conversation.</p>
                                        <p> Brands can capitalize on trending topics via Facebook and Twitter. Although you only have a short window to make such content relevant, topics can be extremely popular. This classic tweet by Oreo a few years ago, which received nearly 15,000 Retweets, was a good example.</p>
                                       

                                        <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold">  Post at optimal times </h3>

                                        <p> Certain times in the day are when social media posts get the most engagement. To schedule the best times for your content, use a scheduler such as Hootsuite or Buffer App.</p>
                                        <p> Quick sprout has a nice infographic that shows the best times to post on various networks. It's better to test the times that work for you and your audience before blindly following these timings.</p>
                                       
                                        <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> Post Fridays </h3>

                                       
                                        <p> According to research published in the Social Intelligence Report, Fridays are the best days for comments, likes, and shares. </p>
                                        
                                        <ul>

                                            <li> 17% of all comments are made on Fridays. </li>
                                            <li>  Fridays are the day that 16% of all likes take place. </li>
                                            <li> Fridays account for 16% of shares. </li>
                                            <li> Sunday is the most unlikely day to get a comment on a blog post </li>


                                            </ul>
                                        
                                        
                                        <p> The Social Media Examiner says that these findings are consistent to Facebook data from several years back, which shows that Facebook's Happiness Index spikes on Fridays." It might be wise to not ignore weekends when scheduling content.</p>


                                        <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold"> Use hashtags </h3>
                                        <p> Hashtags were first introduced to Twitter in 2012 and have since spread to Facebook, Instagram, and Google+. This article explains how hashtags make it easy for anyone to find your content, even if they don't follow you. Hashtags get twice the social media engagement as tweets without them, and 55 percent more likely are to be retweeted.</p>
                                        <p> Twitter engagement drops if you use more hashtags than 2. It's best not to use more than two hashtags on any social network, except Instagram, where more is better.</p>

                                        <h3 class="card-title mb-3 font-weight-bold">  Insert a CTA in the Post. </h3>
                                        <p> CTA stands for call-to-action. It is a direct instruction to tell your audience what you want. A CTA is essential to increasing your ROI if you run an ad. Even if you don't post regular content, you can increase engagement by asking your followers to respond using one of these CTAs:</p>
